Excel Automation
	You can interact with Excel files in one of two ways

		Use Excel App
			requires MS Office excel installed
			Multiple process can use the same file
			Visible real-time changes

		Direct Access
			Does not require MS office
				(not is spelt wrong in this tutorial lol)
			Only one process can use the file
			Works only for xlsx format

	Its important to Differeniate between Excel documents and Data Tables when automating this stuff

		Excel Docuemtents can conatin any number of indvidual data tables, images, merged cells and formulas whereas data tables are the similest form of spreadsheet data, rows and columns.

	The guy in the video says colon : strangly
		like is stretches out then on in colon like the last sylable in Romulan.
		also is pronouces data with a r sound at the end like data(r)
