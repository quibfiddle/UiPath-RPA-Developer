UI Interactions
	All interactions fall into one of two categories; Input and Output

		Input action examples
			clicks
			text typing
			keyboard shortcuts
			right clicks
			mosue hover

		Output action examples
			getting text
			find elements and images
			clipboard operations


	There a few different input methos with their various strengths and weaknesses
		Default
			This will work 100% of the time, but as it is just emulating clicks and keystrokes with a virtual mouse/keyboard, it can be pretty slow.

		Windows Message
			This works about 80% of the time, at the same speed as default, but can run in the background

		Simulate Type/Click
			This works most of the time *like 99% of webpages and 60% of desktop apps*, can run in the background, works at 100% speed, and can automaticly empty a field for new input.

Screen Scraping
	Screen scrapping is like that copy field function we used earlier, BUT, generally used for 
		bigger blocks of text
		when information is behind a complex UI
		you need exact word position on screen

	There are three main Screen Scraping Methods:
		FullText
			Its fast, acurate, works in the background, an occasionaly reveals hidden information
		Native
			Slightly slower, 100% accurate, and can capture text position in an app
		OCR
			much slower than the other two, 98% accurate, but works in Citrix
				IT looks at the indicated area as an image, and tries to read it.

Webpages often present items / results / objects in a repeating structured form, and UiPath has a tool for extracting that data into a usable form:
	Data Scarping tool allows you to select recuring elements, and it will try and figure out the pattern at which they ocour, and build a DataTable Output

Practical Applications

Create a short sequence that does the following:
Attaches to a browser window on this page
Scrapes all names and prices until 100 items are reached
Writes scraped data into a newly created Excel Spreadsheet
