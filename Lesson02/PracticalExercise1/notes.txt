Create a flowchart which performs the following actions: 
Starts by asking the user a mathematical question (e.g. the equation, 1+1 =2) in a Message Box with Yes/No choices and capturing the user's answer:

A. If the user answered Yes (which is the True answer):

Opens Notepad.exe
Attaches to the window of Notepad.exe
Upon attaching to the window, types Correct into it.
B. If the user chose No (which is the False answer):

Does the same series of actions as the True branch. However, instead of typing Correct, types Incorrect into Notepad.
Finally, closes the Notepad application.

The workflow has validation errors. Review and resolve them first.

Compiler error(s) encountered processing expression "yes".
'yes' is not declared. It may be inaccessible due to its protection level.
	fixed by removeing default value from the variable. I think i forgot to include yes in quotes
