Im excited to work with the REFramework with out changing the variable type of TransactionItem; that always set off an avalanche of fuckups. LET'S GOOOO.

Just to get this down for Extract vendor information, i just adapted my extract customer information from last exercise.


VendorTaxID = VendorInformationDetails.Split(Environment.NewLine.ToArray, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)(0)

out_VendorTaxID = ClientID.Split({“TaxID: ”},StringSplitOptions.None)(1).ToString

ran into this error:
Assign: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

duh, switched variable im splitting to

out_VendorTaxID = VendorTaxID.Split({“TaxID: ”},StringSplitOptions.None)(1).ToString

alright, it is now working and passing out the TAXID as a argument.

sample WIID for generate yearly report for vendor:
RO094782

["January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December"]

row(0).toString

the escape characters are {()} btw' when you are working in the selector editor you can highlight something and right click on it to assign it to a varriable

RO094782
