<html app='chrome.exe' title='ACME System 1 - Work Items' />
<webctrl aaname='"+in_TransactionItem+"' tag='A' />

I am setting the selector in the process to the above. I may need to rearanaged the escape characters.

WorkItems.Select("Type='WI4' AND Status='open'")

For the process of generating the queue items, im just going to use code used to extraced the WI5Items from last exercise.

Found out the wierd issue with login's I forgot to deply the published process, so the robot was unable to get assets from Orchestrator.

Ok still having that same issue. Going to try and see 

Get Asset Value: Invalid asset type was specified for asset '{0}'.

Ok, so i figured out what the problem is and fixed it with a hack of sorts. Essentially im not assigning the variable correclty in the config, and it shows up as null when the get app credentials is called.

I just changed the argument from the variable i establish in the config called System1Credential to a straight up hardcoded string value of "System1Credential" which orchestrator is able to use and provide the correct credential asset to it. 

I tried a few different settings in the config. It should just be
Name 				Value
System1Credential	"System1Credential"

but it just doesn't like that, and instead set ups the System1Credential variable as a null string.

Eitherway, the dispatcher is working and has created a queue of items in Orchestrator. Onto the Preformer.
