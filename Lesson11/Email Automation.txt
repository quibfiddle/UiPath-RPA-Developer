Email Automation
Email can be thought about two ways with UiPath
	Input via e-mail
		Emails recieved can contain Names or IDs in the subject or body
		Input files coming as attachments

	Output via e-mail
		Automation progress reports
		Automation Exception reports

By defualt UiPath can interact with mailboxes in a couple ways
	By logging in and working directly with the mailbox via SMTP / Pop3 / IMAP / Exchange

	or

	by integrating with Outlook, and automating steps taken within that application.

Got logged into my stuart@stuartbingham.net mailbox for this.

get.IMAP mail messagess has a variable output type of
	list<MailMessage>
