Shrek: Um, Shrek.4. Picture book activity.  Shrek is based on a book called 
Shrek.  The original story is quite different from the film you 
know. At the beginning of the original Shrek story,  Shrek lives with his parents, 
who kick him out because he is too old to stay with them, as the picture below 
shows.  Here are some lines from the story. They are all jumbled up. Try to set 
them in the right order. You will see how different the real story is:

“The princess said: “’Your nose is so hairy,/ oh, let us not tarry,/ your look so scary,/ 
I think we should marry’.

“One day Shrek’s parents kicked him goodbye. Shrek left the black hole where he 
had been born. In a forest he found a witch.  She was busy boiling bats in turtle 
juice.” 

“Shrek said to the witch: ‘Tell my fortune, madam, and I’ll let you have a few of my 
lice’. ‘Splendid!’ Said the witch. ‘Here is your fortune’:

‘Otchky, potchky, itchky-pitch / pay attention to this witch./ A donkey takes you to a 
knight/Him you conquer in a fight./ Then you wed a princess who/ is even uglier 
than you./Ha ha ha and cockadoodle, / the magic words are ‘Apple Strudel’.

‘A princess!’ Shrek said. ‘I’m on my way!’.

“Like fire and smoke these two should be together. So they got married as soon as 
possible. And they lived horribly ever after.”

Shrek continued his journey.  Then he saw a donkey grazing. Was this the donkey 
the witch had said? Shrek tried the magic words:  ‘Apple Struddel!’. The donkey said. ‘I’ll take you to the knight, to the castle, where the repulsive princess waits’. 
Shrek got on the donkey’s back.

“Shrek crossed the bridge and went into the castle. And there, for the first time, he 
found out what fear was.”

“Shrek came out of the Hall of Mirrors and continued walking into the castle. There 
before him was the ugliest princess on the surface of the planet. ‘Apple Strudel’, he 
said. ‘Cockadoodoodle’, said the princess.”

“They soon came to the bridge of the castle where a knight stood.  Shrek 
commanded: ‘Do me the honour to step aside, so I can go and meet my bride’. Shrek 
opened his mouth and spitted a blast of fire. The knight became red-hot”.

“All around him were hundreds of ugly creatures. He was so afraid he couldn’t spit a 
bit of flame. When he started to run, all the ugly creatures ran. He was in the Hall of 
Mirrors. ‘They are all me!’. ‘ALL ME!’”.
