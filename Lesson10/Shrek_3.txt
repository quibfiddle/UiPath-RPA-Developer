I-Nj-Ky IlCssOnce upon a time in a far away swamp there lived an ornery
ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) whose precious solitude is
suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy tale char-
acters. There are blind mice in his food, a big, bad wolf in his
bed, three little homeless pigs, and more, all banished from
their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow).
Determined to save their home—not to mention his own—
Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue the
beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to be Farquaad's
bride. Accompanying him on his mission is a wisecracking
Donkey (Eddie Murphy) who will do anything for Shrek .. .
except shut up. Rescuing the Princess from a fire-breathing
dragon may prove the least of their problems when the deep,
dark secret she has been keeping is revealed.
Shrek is based on the children's book by William Steig. "Working with the . band Halfcocked on the song "Bad
Reputation" was a true pleasure. What a great band, and
what a great movie!!!"
Joe Barresi, producer of "Bad Reputation"
"We really enjoyed working on the soundtrack for the movie
Shrek. It was the first animated movie I personally had ever
seen and thought Eddie Murphy was off the hook. We hope
to be a part of a DreamWorks production again soon."
— Isaiah Taylor, Baha Men"We (Halfcocked) had an amazing time being involved with
the Shrek soundtrack. Not only are we extremely honored to
cover a song by one of our heros, Joan Jett, but we also feel
privileged to be part of such a great, successful project that
uses a bitter, ugly, green ogre as its star. Thanks, Shrek!!"
Rock on!
— Sarah Reitkopp, lead singer for Halfcocked
(performed "Bad Reputation") In some ways, Shrek is your classic fairy tale. It has a hero, a
beautiful princess, and a dastardly villain. Unlike the fairy tales
of old, however, the hero is an ugly, ill-tempered ogre, the
princess is not all she appears to be, and the villain has some
obvious shortcomings.
Shrek producer and DreamWorks principal Jeffrey Katzenberg
notes, "Shrek kind of looks backwards at all the fairy tale tra-
ditions we grew up on, and takes great fun turning all those
storytelling conventions upside-down and inside-out."
Producer and head of PDl/DreamWorks Aron Warner agrees
that a lot of the fun in Shrek comes from lampooning some of
our most beloved fairy tale characters, even throwing in some
Mother Goose favorites for good measure. "We basically took
every fairy tale in the book-and turned it on its side. Nothing
is sacred; every fairy tale gets roasted. These characters are
ripe for parody because they're part of the cosmic conscious-
ness, so to speak."In addition to breaking the mold of fairy tale conventions,
Shrek also showcases some amazing breakthroughs in what
have been referred to as the "Holy Grails" of computer ani-
mation, the first being realistic humans, who are able to
express both dialogue and emotion through a complex facial
animation system developed at PDI. Using special tools called
"Shapers," the animators were able to achieve sophisticated
facial and body movements by applying interacting layers of
bone, muscle, fat, skin, hair, and clothing. There are also
advances in the creation of rich, organic environments; clothing
that moves, wrinkles and reacts to light like real-life fabric; fire;
and fluids of different viscosities, achieved using
PDl/DreamWorks' award-winning Fluid Animation System (FLU).
"The computer has been revolutionary in animation—not evo-
lutionary, revolutionary. There is absolutely no question that
Shrek is far and above anything that's been done in computer
animation," says Katzenberg, who is quick to qualify, "for at
least ten seconds. Yes, it's state of the art, but do I think it will
be the benchmark for a long time to come? No. It will be the
benchmark for about a day or two. I say that with a sense of
humor, but that's what's exciting about computer animation;
it's evolving exponentially. With today's digital tools, it seems
if we can dream it, we can make it."
Of course, long before they could dream it, the filmmakers
had to read it. The movie Shrek has its origins in a short illus-
trated book of the same name by award-winning children's
author William Steig. Steig's story of an ogre who sets out
into the world to find adventure first came to the attention of
producer John H. Williams via a very close source. Williams
recounts, "Every development deal starts with a pitch and my
pitch came from my then kindergartner, in collaboration with his pre-school brother. Upon our second reading of Shrek, the
kindergartner started quoting large segments of the book pre-
tending he could read them. Even as an adult, I thought Shrek
was outrageous, irreverent, iconoclastic, gross, and just a lot
of fun. He was a great movie character in search of a movie.'
Screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, who had previous-
ly worked with Katzenberg and Warner on Antz, collaborated
with Joe Stillman and Roger S. H. Schulman to adapt the
story into an animated action adventure, told with humor and
heart, under the direction of Andrew Adamson and
Vicky Jenson.
The heart of the story is found in what could be called—in the
language of all fables—the moral of the story. Vicky Jenson
relates, "The story is about self-acceptance and that things
aren't always as they appear. We definitely turn the concept of
beauty on its ear, which I think is a very powerful theme."
That being said, Adamson adds, "Yes, there's a moral to the
story and it has tremendous heart, but all of that, I hope,
comes ultimately through humor."
"We set out to create a joyful, fun expression of all the things
we'd like to see and, really, to make ourselves laugh," Warner
agrees. "l think humor is universal when it's good, and there's
a lot of stuff to laugh at in this movie, depending on what you
know and remember about the world of fairy tales. We hit on
elements that have been so much a part of all our lives, and
we had the right actors in the right place at the right time. It
just all came together."'ELL'
C)
Accompanying the characters on their adventures is a musi-
cal score composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and John
Powell, who had previously collaborated on the scores of
DreamWorks' animated hits Antz and Chicken Run.
Juxtaposed with the orchestral score in the film are song
selections from an eclectic group of artists, including Baha
Men, Smash Mouth, Joan Jett, Rupert Holmes, Herb Alpert
and the Tijuana Brass, and DreamWorks recording artists
eels, Self, Leslie Carter, and Dana Glover. Glover's song, "It Is
You (l Have Loved)," was originally a score cue from com-
posers Gregson-Williams and Powell, to which Glover wrote
lyrics, turning it into one of the featured songs in the film.
Like the story, the songs will relate differently to audiences,
depending on their age and musical tastes, but, Katzenberg
offers, "As much as any movie I've worked on these last 20
years, this one genuinely has something for everyone. It's
such an irreverent comedy, but at its core is an incredible
heart. It really talks to the fact that there's a place for each and
every one of us, and someone to share it with."
Long before Shrek was animated, the filmmakers hand-
picked many of these songs. Each holds a lyric that tells us
more of our story and expresses Shrek's point of view. The
songs are as eclectic as our fairy tale creatures. These
musicians and songwriters have great wit and a keen
sense of adventure. Our composers, Harry and John,
blended these songs with their original underscore to cre-
ate a one of a kind musical journey.
— Marylata E. Jacob, Music Supervisor Warner agrees, "l think its theme is a very important one
these days—that beauty not only isn't everything, it can mean
absolutely nothing. We live in a world that's obsessed with the
way people look. love the fact that we were able to tell a story
where the so-called beautiful people don't always win."
Katzenberg concludes, "It really is an allegory in which we can
find something about our own lives. Each of our characters
comes to understand that there is something wonderful—
warts and all—about who they are. I think that's true for all of
us: that the people who ultimately come to know and love us
see the strengths inside of us. Whether you're a princess, a
donkey, or even a big, green, stinky ogre, you can find love
and happiness."
Shrek was the third film that Harry and I scored together
for Jeffrey Katzenberg and DreamWorks. So you'd think
that it would be getting easier, wouldn't you? Whilst it was
a wonderful film to work on (we could tell that from the
first rough cut we saw), and whilst we were teamed up
with a great group of people (some of whom we knew very
well by then—the darling Marylata Jacob, for one), Shrek
was still, with all of these advantages, a difficult project to
do. At times Harry and I felt as if we were crossing the
same rickety bridge that Shrek and Donkey crossed above
the lake of fiery lava (but I can't reveal who was the fright-
ened one). Making music for this film required us to walk
a thin line between sentiment and subversion, truthful
emotion and sticky sap, comedy and action, fruit and nuts.
But like Shrek and Donkey, we got to the other side and
wondered what all of the hollering had been about.
— John Powell, co-composer of musical score
(with Harw Gregson-Williams)
"It is rare to have an opportunity to work on a movie
such as Shrek. I was thrilled and honored to collaborate
with composers I so admire."
— Dana Glover; artist and lyricist for
"It Is You (l Have Loved)"— Voiced by Mike Myers, Shrek is a big, green,
ugly, smelly ogre. Perfectly content just living alone in his
swamp, he enjoys taking mud showers, eating forest critters,
and scaring the spit out of anyone who crosses his path. It
takes a princess that packs a punch to finally soften his heart.
DONKEY — Voiced by Eddie Murphy, this Donkey's no
jackass—he talks, sings, hums, dances, and just won't shut
up. As Shrek's unlikely sidekick, it doesn't take long to see his
charming and optimistic nature. He finds true friendship and a
hot romance where he least expects it.
PRINCESS FOONA — Voiced by Cameron Diaz,
Princess Fiona is every guy's dream. She is not only beautiful,
but she's able to drop-kick a band of outlaws and eats weed-
rats with the best of them. She's smart, tough, and spirited,
but she is also a princess with a deep, dark secret who waits
patiently for her one true love to sweep her off her feet.
FARQUAAD — Voiced by John Lithgow, Lord
Farquaad, the measly four-foot-tall ruler of Duloc, is the
antithesis of Shrek—neat, orderly, and power-hungry. He's a
control freak who would like nothing better than to rid the land
of all undesirable fairy tale creatures and create his own per-
fect world. Mike Myers, the

2. Your faith was strong, but you needed proof.
You saw her bathing on the roof.
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.
She tied you to a kitchen chair.
She broke your throne; she cut your hair.
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah. (To Chorus)
3. Maybe I have been here before.
I know this room; I've walked this floor.
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch.
Love is not a victory march.
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah. (To Chorus)
4. There was a time you let me know
What's real and going on below.
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you,
The holy dark was movin' too,
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah. (To Chorus)
5. Maybe there's a God above,
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.
And it's not a cry you can hear at night.
It's not somebody who's seen the light.
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah. (To Chorus)I'm on My Way
