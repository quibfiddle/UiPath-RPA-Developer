PDF Automation
	So before even messing around with this lesson, we are going to install the base version of Acrobat Reader DC, as newer versions make the selector slightly more unreliable.

	Also, im just throwing reader on there. Not acrobat. Hopefully there are no input steps in this lesson *there probably are.

Looks like pdf dependancies are not installed by default,
	just select the packet manager.

UiPath has activities associated with PDFs split into two major categories
	Large Texts
		Read PDF Text Activity

	Specific Elements
		leveraging the screen scraping tool, we can select and work with specific parts of a given pdf.

UiPaths primary application dependancy package can read pdfs with two activities:
	readpdf
		Just grabs all the actual text from the pdf and assign it to a variable
	read pdf with OCR
		uses Optical Character REcognition to translate images back into characters
		THis shit takes forever on big pdfs.
