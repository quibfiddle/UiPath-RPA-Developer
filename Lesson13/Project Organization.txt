Project Organization
	The main goals of Project Organization are to make the project more
		Reliable
		Efficient
		Maintainable
		Extensible

Best Practices
	Pick an appropriate layout for each workflow
		Know when to use a Flowchart vs a Sequence

		Flowcharts
			Generally used for the main Work Flow.


		Sequences
			Ui Interactions are better suited for Sequence
			Avoid using too many nested If statements, instead opting for Flow Chart Decisions

	Break the whole process in smaller workflows
		Develop and test pieces independently

		Reuse workflows across projects

		collaborate working on seperate files

	Use Exception handling
		Make full use of the try/catch to at least log problematic steps, for later error correction.

		Having a loop, or error handling decision flow will allow you to reset the automation to a working state in the event of a failure.

	Make your Workflows readable
		Other people may need to read/debug it
		Give discriptive names to all your components/activities
		comment your code
		keep environment settings in a seperate file

	Keep it clean
		Have the automation close the windows it is working with when done, or you will run into an eventual slow down were you have countless applications / webpages open.

Invoking a workflow
	You can put sequences/flow charts into a workflow, which you can then add that workflow to other projects to gain that workflows steps and functionallity

	Invoking a workflow will cause the variables of that workflow become arguments which can be passed in, out or in/out into the parent workflow
